//! Block classification for the markdown emitter.
//!
//! Consumes `ProjectedLine` entries from each `ParsedPage` and groups them into
//! a sequence of `Block`s: headings, paragraphs, list items, code blocks,
//! tables (ruled and borderless), horizontal rules, and figures. Tabular
//! regions that can't be classified confidently fall back to a fenced grid
//! projection rather than a mangled pipe table.
